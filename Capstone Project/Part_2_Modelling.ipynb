    "\n",
    "1. **API Configuration**: The geocoding service used here is provided by `geloky.com`. The function `get_coordinates_from_address` is responsible for making requests to this service. An API key is necessary for authenticating the requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Default Coordinates**: As a backup mechanism, in case the geocoding service fails to provide coordinates for a given address or if there's an issue with the API, the script has default coordinates set to Tokyo's geographical center. This ensures that the function always returns a set of coordinates. We can also use this to evaluate if our model is accurately giving us correct coordinates, or if it is unable to process the addresses given. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **API Call and Data Parsing**: When the function is called with an address:\n",
    "    - It constructs the API request URL.\n",
    "    - Makes an HTTP GET request to the service.\n",
    "    - Parses the JSON response to extract the latitude and longitude.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: If the API doesn't return successful results, or if the address doesn't match any known locations in the geocoding service's database, the function prints a relevant message and falls back to the default Tokyo coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**: This script can be integrated into applications where geographical data is required. It abstracts the complexities of interacting with the geocoding API and provides a straightforward method to get coordinates from an address."
